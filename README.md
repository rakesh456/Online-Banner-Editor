Online-Banner-Editor
====================

Simple Banner Editor using JS (work in progress).
A small prototype of an online banner editor. You can add a text string, move around the string in the banner area, add an image and move around the image in the banner area using the prototype. You will need to add text first, otherwise it will not be displayed.

I have copied all js files from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/minipaint. All of them may not be in use.
